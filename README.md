## Minimal Portfolio – GitHub Pages

This is a single–page, minimal portfolio site built to be hosted with GitHub Pages.

### How to use this for your own portfolio

- **Edit basic info**:  
  - Open `index.html` and replace the placeholder text in the **hero**, **About**, **Projects**, and **Contact** sections with your own content.  
  - Update the email in the Contact section (`mailto:you@example.com`) and any social links.

- **Tweak the design**:  
  - Open `styles.css` to adjust colors, fonts, or spacing.  
  - The main colors are defined at the top in the `:root` block.

### How to deploy with GitHub Pages

1. **Push this repo to GitHub** under the name `aarushisingh04.github.io` (or your-own-username.github.io).  
2. Go to **Settings → Pages** in the GitHub repository.  
3. Under **Source**, select `Deploy from a branch`.  
4. Choose the `main` branch and the root folder (`/`), then click **Save**.  
5. After a minute or two, your site will be live at  
   `https://USERNAME.github.io` (replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username).

You can edit and commit changes at any time—GitHub Pages will redeploy automatically.
